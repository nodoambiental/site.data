The stated license applies to every file that does not contain its own licensing inside its folder.

This means that every folder that has content on it will contain a LICENSE file that specifies under what license the content on that folder is released. This is setup in this fashion because some posts/publications will need to have completely different licensing requirements. Most licenses will fall inside the copyleft spectrum anyways.

Some files will have their own licenses ignoring the ones of the folder. In this case, a special file called EXCEPTIONS will be created in the folder. This file will contain a list of files that are not covered by the license of the folder.

The special folder EXTERNAL will contain extraneous files that may have any special licensing requirements and/or are vendored from some other source. This is important because the files that may be found in EXTERNAL can have any arbitrary license and might not abide by any open licensing whatsoever, so tread carefully there.
